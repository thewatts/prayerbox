# PrayerBox
- My attempt to build an Ember.js type application similiar to
  [FRVNT](http://frvnt.com), built by [@noahstokes](http://github.com/noahstokes).

## Why?
- More than anything, I'm striving to learn Ember.js and connect it with
  a Rails API. I figured this would be a good project to learn with!

## Can I contribue?
- Sure! I always love partnering with folks on projects!
